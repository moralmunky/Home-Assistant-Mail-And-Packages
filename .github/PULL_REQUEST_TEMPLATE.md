## Breaking change
<!--
  If your PR contains a breaking change for existing users, it is important
  to tell them what breaks, how to make it work again and why we did this.
  This piece of text is published with the release notes, so it helps if you
  write it towards our users, not us.
  Note: Remove this section if this PR is NOT a breaking change.

  Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the
  maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug
  or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue in the
